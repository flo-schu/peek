# Introduction

## Motivation

Species have varying sensitivity to chemical and environmental stress.
If stress is recurring and time for recovery is not sufficient, resilient
species will outcompete the other [@Liess.2013] in ecosystems which are
under default conditions stable for both species.



## Recent Findings

[@Gessner.2016] context dependency in stress-effect analyses has until 2016
been under researched.

check research of gardestrÃ¶m et al (2016). They made a research of communities
in streams and the dependence of outcome on the contamination legacy.
This may be important for the second part of the current nanocosm experiment
repeated contamination with low dose pesticide after initial contamination with
esfenvalerate of different dose


[@Wood.2017] show how neonicotinoides are flushed into rivers after peak rain
events. This shows that repeated pulse exposures are a much more meaningful
approach to testing the effect of pesticides in contrast to continuous exposure,
which practically does not take place. It would be interesting to have a small
background exposure present at all times.


## Assumptions

(1) Communities converge towards a cyclic attractor after initialization.

(3) Environmental stress affects the stability of the attractors
(4) Refuges and renewal of population would generally stabilize the communities

## Research Questions

(1) Identify the drivers of community change. Candidates are: Stressors (Pesticides,
    Environmental Variables, Community Structure - Competition, Timing)

(2) When are communities resilient to pesticides and environmental stress? And
    when are they particularly vulnerable?

(3) Can organisms be detected and quantified with machine learning algorithms
    -> upscaling of non invasive techniques.

(4) Genetic variation in population during time course or after stress events

## Hypotheses

(1)
(2) Communities can recover from small perturbations but ecosystems will change
    after larger perturbations occurred
