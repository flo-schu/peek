# improvements for thursday
# 1. take photos with timer and avoid any movement (light, ersch√ºtterungen)
# 2. longer time between consecutive fotos should allow also for movement of culex

# moving on:
# FIXES:
# lag 2 does not work yet. There is a shadow which is also tracked. Why?

# 1. write algorithm which builds annotated database
# display picture, context, and choose with key button
# D: Daphnia
# K: Culex
# B: Neither nor

# Based on this, a two step workflow can be developed:
# 1. Selection on classifying objects this should capture rather too many than too few
#    This can be based on motion detection or any other detector
# 2. classification to differentiate between D/C/N
